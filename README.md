# hapiest
*hapiest* is a GUI that works with the HITRAN API, enabling access
to all sorts of spectrographic data without knowledge of python.

# How to Install
Hapiest currently has no binary packages, but it's python dependencies and the program itself can be downloaded
with the [install.py](https://github.com/hapiest-team/hapiest/blob/master/install.py) script.

You must have python 3 installed to install and use hapiest.

For windows, mac, or linux, download [install.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hapiest-team/hapiest/master/install.py) and run it in the directory you want the hapiest folder to be created.

For mac and linux you can run `wget -O install.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hapiest-team/hapiest/master/install.py && python install.py`

After you install hapiest, you can start it by calling `run` in a command prompt or terminal. If you are on mac you may
have to edit the `run` file and replacing `python` with `python3`.
